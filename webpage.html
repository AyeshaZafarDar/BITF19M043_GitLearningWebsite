    <h2><u><b>Step 1</b></u></h2> 
    <p>• After creating a new, empty git repository and adding some content to the query.html file, I made two commits to the
    master branch.</p>
    <center>
        <h3><u><b>Snapshot of Query.html File</b></u></h3>

        <h3><u>Snapshot of executed Git commands & its Description</u></h3>
        <p><b>git init: </b> Creates a brand-new repository in the Git version control system. This is the primary command to master if you intend to
        use revision control with your project.</p>
        <p><b>git add [filename]:</b>Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot
        before committing it to the official history.</p>
        <p><b>git commit -m [message]:</b>Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history with a message. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow
        for all Git users.</p>
        <img src="images/image2.png" alt="">
        <h3><u>Displays a record of all commits made to the repository's master branch using the Git log command</u></h3>
        <p><b>git log: </b>This command is used to check the commit history.</p>
        <img src="images/image3.png" alt="">
    </center>
    <h2><u><b>Step 2</b></u></h2>
    <p>• Using the git checkout -b feature command, I've established a new Branch called feature.</p>
    <p>• Since there are now two distinct branches, Master and Feature, I decided to make a few edits to the query.html file in
    the feature branch.</p>
    <center>
        <h3><u><b>Snapshot of Query.html File</b></u></h3>
        <img src="images/image4.png" alt="">
        <h3><u>Snapshot of executed Git commands & its Description</u></h3>
        <p><b>git checkout -b [branchName]:</b> Create the new branch on your local machine and switch in this branch.</p>
        <p><b>git branch: </b>This command lists all the branches available in the repository.</p>
        <img src="images/image5.png" alt="">
        <h3><u>Displays a record of all commits made to the repository's master & feature branch using the Git log command</u></h3>
        <p><b>git log: </b>This command is used to check the commit history.</p>
        <img src="images/image6.png" alt="">
    </center>
    <h2><u><b>Step 3</b></u></h2>
    <p>• Once again, using the command "git checkout master," I have returned to the master branch and made some edits to the
    query.html file.</p>
    <center>
        <h3><u><b>Snapshot of Query.html File</b></u></h3>
        <img src="images/image7.png" alt="">
        <h3><u>Snapshot of executed Git commands & its Description</u></h3>
        <p><b>git checkout [branchName]: </b> This command is used to switch from one branch to another.</p>
        <img src="images/image8.png" alt="">
        <h3><u>Displays a record of all commits made to the repository's master branch using the Git log command</u></h3>
        <p><b>git log: </b>This command is used to check the commit history.</p>
        <img src="images/image9.png" alt="">
        <h3>I used the command “git log --all” to view every single commit I've made to both the master and the feature branches.</h3>
        <img src="images/image10.png" alt="">
    </center>
    <h2><u><b>Step 4</b></u></h2>
    <p>• And now, with the help of the git merge feature command, I'd want to combine my two branches, master and feature.</p>
    <center>
        <p><b>git merge [branchname]: </b>This command merges the specified branch’s history into the current branch.</p>
        <img src="images/image11.png" alt="">
    </center>
    <p>• Since just one line of the query.html file was modified between the master and feature branches highlighted in the
    above snapshot, a merge conflict has arisen as a result of this difference in content. In order to fix this, I've
    decided to go ahead and commit to the change that was made in the feature branch.</p>
    <p>• A snapshot of the master and feature branches being merged after a conflict was resolved is shown below.</p>

        <h3><u>Snapshot of executed Git commands & its Description</u></h3>
        <p><b>git status: </b>This command lists all the files that have to be committed.</p>
